# 🧠 Apex Brain | High-Performance Cognitive Lab

**Apex Brain** is a minimalist, high-intensity brain training application built with React Native. It focuses on improving neural plasticity through spatial memory, reaction timing, and inhibitory control.

---

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Neural Pulse Engine:** High-speed 3x3 grid training designed for sub-300ms reaction times.
* **Apex Progression:** Dynamic ranking system (Novice ➔ Focused ➔ Elite ➔ Apex).
* **Inhibitor Traps:** Integrated "Red Tile" logic to train inhibitory control and precision.
* **Ghost Mode:** Compete against your own previous peak performance data.
* **Global Leaderboards:** Real-time Firebase integration to rank against the world's top performers.
* **Tactile Feedback:** Precision haptics (on mobile) for sensory-reinforced learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React Native (Expo)
- **State Management:** React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage (Local) & Firebase Firestore (Global)
- **Feedback:** Expo-Haptics
- **Environment:** Developed in GitHub Codespaces

## 📱 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Apex-Brain.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Launch the app: `npx expo start --tunnel`
4. Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on iOS or Android.

## 🧪 The Science
Apex Brain utilizes the **Spatial Match Task** principle. By decreasing the stimulus-to-response interval (SRI), the app encourages faster synaptic firing and sustained attentional focus.
